# Depot Delivery Optimization

## Problem Statement
In this project, we are tasked with delivering items from a central depot to \( n \) different locations using \( k \) vehicles in the most optimal way. The challenge lies in determining the optimal routes for each vehicle to minimize the total distance traveled.

## Aim
The aim of this project is to find the optimal distance for \( k \) vehicles to deliver items from the depot to \( n \) locations. By optimizing the routes, we aim to minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles while ensuring timely and efficient delivery. Optimal distance is defined as the total distance traveled by \( k \) vehicles, aiming to reduce fuel consumption, wear and tear on vehicles, and associated costs.

## Problems Tackled
One of the main problems tackled by this project is load balancing. It involves distributing the distance traveled among the \( k \) trucks optimally to ensure that each vehicle carries a fair share of the load and that no vehicle is overburdened while others remain underutilized. By achieving load balancing, we aim to maximize the efficiency of the delivery process and reduce overall costs associated with transportation.
